							<p>  The Women's March was a worldwide protest on January 21, 2017, to advocate legislation and policies regarding human rights and other issues, including women's rights, immigration reform, healthcare reform, reproductive rights, the natural environment, LGBTQ rights, racial equality, freedom of religion, and workers' rights. 
							<br><br>
							For demonstrating the use case for descriptive analysis on text data, we extracted the data of speech transcripts of multiple speakers of Women's March. The speakers include Angela Davis, Madonna, Gloria Steinem, Ashley Judd, and America Ferrera. We cleaned the data set by removing stop words, fixing normalization of keywords, and performed tokenization. The free flowing text tokens were then aggregated, linked together and run through our theme, sentiment and tone detection in order to unearth insights with respect to different speakers. For theme and sentiment detection, we used IBM Watson that takes the text as input and outputs the tone and sentiment of the text. All of the derived data was then intermingled together with the real domain knowledge. Contexts from their speeches, their themes, and keywords used were checked in other datasets such as twitter, news postings etc. In short, the following process represents the analysis flow: <br><br>
								1. Dataset Curation <br>
								2. Dataset Cleaning <br>
								3. Text Tokenization <br>
								4. Token Normalisation and Aggregation <br>
								5. Theme, Sentiment and Tone Detection <br>
								6. Contextual Insights using Business Analysis <br>
								7. Domain Knowledge Insights <br><br>
