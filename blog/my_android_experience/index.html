							<p>                    The intent of this blog is to give an outline of my academic android project.                     <br /><br />                    After scouting for different app ideas, I decided to make a utility application on the android platform which was supposed to control the computers according to voice instructions given by the user on their mobile phones.                     <br /><br />                    I decided to name this app "APVC", acronym for Android Pc Voice Controller. This application was supposed to operate Pcs, used for quick and accurate text typing, playing audio and video files and a number of more functionalities.                    <br /><br />                    To get a comfort level in android platform, I created some sample applications in android like calculator, text editor and a mini music player. In case of APVC, networking, speech to text voice recognization were important features. For the networking purposes, I used WIFI communication channel to establish a connection between the server and the client ie. mobile and the PC. The app was able to pass textual data between the two.                     <br /><br />                    To Implement the voice recognition feature, I implemented the speech to text android intent in my application and it seemed very appalling. The app was able to receive the text version of whatever was spoken between the two platforms.                    <br /><br />                    I integrated all the distributed snippets to give a structure to complete project. Later the feature of authentication was added. Only if the correct key was passed, the app server would response. In the server side, multithreading was introduced to execute the functions and process synchronously. I created the methods that manipulated the received input strings. For example if text "Open Notepad" was received, then the methods would execute a command that would open the notepad in the pc.                     <br /> <br />                     In the similar manner, I created about 25 functionalities that would perform different tasks. I developed the feature of text typing in my project. The same functionality was replicated on the notepad, browser, chatting, word pad and even command prompt!, which indeed opened up space for many new operations like command line aspects like shutdown, system sleep, opening and closing applications. One interesting feature of this project was opening and playing audio and video files.  The user could explore any directory and play the present audio and video files. Later I added the functions to control sound and speed as well. Features like closing the opened window and entering into new line, special characters typing were also introduced.                    <br /><br />                                         That\'s all my about APVC, you can check out the project <a href="https://github.com/shivam5992/AndroidPcVoiceController">Here</a>.
